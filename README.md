## 🚀 Key Highlights

* **Decentralized Architecture**: Data stays on your device. There is no central database to hack.
* **Federated Learning**: The AI model learns from everyone's data locally, then shares only "smart summaries" to the global map.
* **Risk-Adaptive Privacy**: The system automatically tightens or loosens privacy protections based on real-time local health risks.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove you are part of a healthy (or at-risk) group without revealing who you are.
